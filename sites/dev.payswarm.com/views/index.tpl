    <h2>The Problem</h2>
    <p>
Receiving money and sending money over the Web needs to be simpler.
Pulling out your credit card or signing in to a payment website over and over
again is not simple. Sending or receiving money over the Web needs to be
as simple as sending or receiving an e-mail.

  <div class="span4">
    <h2>What We Need</h2>
    <p>
We need a payment solution that integrates into the Web,
right in your browser. It needs to be like the Web, built on 
open standards and implementable by anyone. Nobody should own the payment
network. After all, nobody owns the Web. The solution is called PaySwarm.

  <div class="span4">
    <h2>The Solution</h2>
    <p>
PaySwarm is an open standard for making payments on the web easier. The technology
is being developed at the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), the same people that
have made the Web what it is today. This website is an alpha release of the 
PaySwarm technology developed at the W3C.

<p>
This site is the <strong>PaySwarm (alpha) Developer Sandbox</strong> and 
enables Web developers to test drive the PaySwarm Web API and technology. 
All interfaces exposed by this website are the same as the ones exposed by 
commercial PaySwarm Authority systems, except for 
one important difference: there is no danger of screwing something up when 
using this development sandbox. No money or accounts on this system are
hooked up to any external system. The training wheels are on; go crazy, 
you won't hurt anyone.
