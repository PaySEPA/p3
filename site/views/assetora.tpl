      <p>Assetora is a service that makes it easier for you to sell the
      creations you host on your website. Using Assetora, you can set what
      your customers will see when they try to purchase items from your
      website and set the parameters for what they'll pay you (or others) in
      order to gain access to those items.</p>
      <p>This service provides you with the tools to design assets and listings
      for your creations. An asset describes your creation and may optionally
      set royalties for it if you want to allow other people to resell your
      work. A listing sets the price and licensing terms for purchasing an
      asset. Assetora allows you to host both asset descriptions and listings
      directly on Meritora, which means there's less for you to set up before
      you can start selling.</p>
