    <h2 class="headline">Marking Up An Article For Sale</h2>

    <p>Once the plugin is installed, the author of a post has a few options
    that they can use to markup the post. They can indicate the pieces of the
    post that must be paid for, what to display for posts that haven't been
    paid for, and where to place the button that initiates the payment
    process.</p>

    <p>A typical post will look like this:</p>

    <pre>This is free content; anyone can see it.

BEGIN_PAYSWARM_PAID_CONTENT

This is paid content; only people who have paid can see it.</pre>

    <p>An author can also provide text that will only be shown for people who
    haven't paid for the post:</p>

    <pre>This is free content; anyone can see it.

BEGIN_PAYSWARM_UNPAID_ONLY_CONTENT
This is unpaid-only content; it will be hidden once the post has been paid for.
END_PAYSWARM_UNPAID_ONLY_CONTENT

BEGIN_PAYSWARM_PAID_CONTENT
This is paid content; only people who have paid can see it.
END_PAYSWARM_PAID_CONTENT</pre>

    <p>The author can also decide where they want to place the button that
    initiates the purchase as well as a short piece of text that will be shown
    beside the access button:</p>

    <pre>This is free content; anyone can see it.

PAYSWARM_ACCESS_BUTTON Fund my coffee addiction so I can post more!

BEGIN_PAYSWARM_PAID_CONTENT
This is paid content; only people who have paid can see it.
END_PAYSWARM_PAID_CONTENT</pre>

    <p>If no access button markup is specified but paid content markup is, then
    the access button will appear, with some default text, at the end of the
    post.</p>

    <p>If you want to add a donation button to your post but keep all of the
    content available for free, just add a PAYSWARM_ACCESS_BUTTON and no other
    special PaySwarm tags:</p>

    <pre>This is free content; anyone can see it. However, please donate so I can
keep creating more great content!

PAYSWARM_ACCESS_BUTTON Donate</pre>

    <p>The price of the post, the license that is granted upon purchase, and
    other post-specific values can be changed on a per-post basis. Future
    versions of the plugin may allow authors to let their readers set their own
    donation amounts for articles.</p>

    <p>When payment is made, it immediately appears in your financial account
    on {{siteTitle}} and can then be withdrawn to a bank account.</p>
