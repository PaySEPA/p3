<h2>{{pageTitle}}</h2>

<p>The PaySwarm pricing system is very flexible. Each PaySwarm Authority can
both set their own pricing models and policies on a site-wide basis, and adjust
and enforce them for every transaction. The current system is very open,
allowing transactions to have details about the full cost breakdown, if
desired.</p>

<p>The development authority simulates a real authority with the following
properties, although many other configurations are possible.</p>

<ul>
<li>All money is in simulated USD (fake USD).</li>
<li>Deposits into a PaySwarm account can come from fake debit cards or
  verified fake bank accounts.</li>
<li>Withdrawals from a PaySwarm account can go to a verified fake bank
  account.</li>
<li>Fake bank accounts are verified with small deposits. In the real world
  this can take as long as 5 days but the development server will email the
  fake verification deposit amounts to you almost immediately.</li>
<li>All fake debit card and fake bank fees are passed on to the account
  holder.</li>
<li>The PaySwarm Authority takes a small percentage of purchase
  transactions.</li>
<li>All fake debit card and fake bank fees are collected to cover the
  simulated cost of third-party processing.
</ul>

<p>The current development authority pricing rates are as follows:<p>

<table class="table">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Action</th>

<p>The above pricing vocabulary terms are based on PaySwarm Payees which can
represent many types of rates. See the <a href="http://payswarm.com">PaySwarm
documentation</a> for the details. For quick reference, the two types of rates
used above are defined below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt id="exclusive">Exclusive</dt>
  <dd>Amounts are added on top of a base amount. For instance, a 2% exclusive card deposit fee for a <span class="money">$1</span> deposit would put $1 in your account and charge your card <span class="money">$1.02</span>.</dd>
  <dt id="inclusive">Inclusive</dt>
  <dd>Amounts are included in the base amount. For instance, an authority with a 2% inclusive rate on a <span class="money">$1</span> purchase would debit the buyer <span class="money">$1</span>, credit the authority <span class="money">$0.02</span>, and credit the seller <span class="money">$0.98</span>.</dd>
</dl>
